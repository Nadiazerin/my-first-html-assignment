    <p style="font-size: large;">Draped in a <b>Bangladeshi</b> national flag, the coffin containing the body of<mark>Abu Sayed</mark>  was kept longer than usual before burial to allow thousands of mourners to pay their last respects.

The <b>25-year-old</b> English literature student at the state-run <b>Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur,</b> in northern Bangladesh, was shot at close range by two police officers <b>on July 16.</b>

He was among seven people, <b>including six students,</b> killed that day as tens of thousands of students held protests<br> on university campuses and streets across the <b>South Asian nation.</b> demanding an end to<b> <i>“unjust and discriminatory quotas”</i></b>for government jobs.The protests began a fortnight ago after a court order restored quotas for government jobs that were abolished in <b><del>2017</del> <ins>2018</ins></b>. The reinstated quota system<b> reserved 30 percent of government</b> jobs to relatives of those who fought in <mark>Bangladesh’s 1971 independence war</mark>.

Another 26 percent was allocated to a few other groups, with the general public having <em>only 44 percent</em> of the jobs. 

This angered young people as many of <b><small>the current political elite of Bangladesh claim to be relatives of freedom fighters</small> </b>and are poised to take the lion's share of government jobs, that are the most secure and sought-after in a country with high<b><u> unemployment, high inflation, and a crippled economy.</b> </u>

The furious students wanted job quotas slashed to <b><u>five percent</u></b> so that the public could get<b><del>90%</del></b>  percent of the jobs. 

As protests spread nationwide, the Supreme Court rolled back its decision,<b><u> on July 22</u>.</b> <mark>It allocated 93% </mark>of jobs for general people,<b> 5% for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minorities, and 1% for third gender and the physically disabled. </b>

<p style="font-size: large;"> Flash floods, which can also be seen as political floods, were triggered by the sudden release of water from the<mark> Dumbur Dam </mark><b>markupstream of the<br> Gomti River in India's Tripura.</b> <i><b>These floods have ravaged several districts in the eastern and southeastern regions of Bangladesh.<br> While it is true that heavy rainfall contributed to the flooding in these districts and that the situation in Tripura was dire, <u><i>India's decision to open the dam without any prior notice demonstrates a shocking lack of consideration</i></u>. How friendly is this behaviour from a neighbouring country that claims to be a 'reliable friend' of Bangladesh?</i></b>

According to the press secretary of the chief adviser of the interim government, the flash floods have stranded at least<b> 3.6 <sub>million</sub> people across 10 <sup>districts</sup>.</b> The situation in<mark> Feni-particularly in the Chhagalnaiya, Phulgazi, and Parshuram</mark> upazilas-has been described as unprecedented, with nearly every home inundated. The situation is dire.<b> At least 16 people have died, and several others are missing.</b> The weather conditions are not conducive to rescue operations, leaving the people of these affected regions utterly helpless.<br> <br>

  Unfortunately, this is proving to be difficult because of the flooding of many health facilities, including the 250-bed Feni General Hospital,<br> that left them severely compromised. The ministry of disaster management and relief has <reportedly deployed 619 medical teams across 11 districts. But ensuring thefull resumption of local health complexes is crucial for uninterrupted care.<br>
